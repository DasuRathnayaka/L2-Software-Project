# Blockchain Based Vehicle Registration and Ownership Management System

## What is this..?
This is a fully decentralized vehicle registration and ownership management system. The centralized system is not good at holding historical data transparently and securely. So we have to move on to the decentralized system. It can track the whole history in a super transparent and secure manner.

## How to do?
Basically we are going to digitalized non-digital asset. We trying to create NFTs to each vehicle to represcent the physical vehicle in the digital world.
 - Register vehicle -> Mint NFT
 - Transfer vehicle ownership (Buy/ Sell) -> Change the ownership of the NFT
 - Crushing vehicle (EoF) -> Burn the NFT

We can map all legal activities regarding the vehicle with an NFT.

## How to Identify the owner digitally?
As well as we issue digital IDs to car owners to break the barrier between the digital and physical worlds. With a Self-sovereign identity (SSI) we can Identify the owner in the digital world. This ID is issued by a recognized government institution. So the authenticity of the digital ID is protected.

## Is data storage secure?
Yes. The images are going to save in IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Other details will be saved in the Polygon blockchain. It use etherium as its sidechain. So we can have Ethereum's security on a low budget. SSI details will be saved in the Indy blockchain. It is a Hyperledger-based blockchain specifically created to save sensitive user data.
